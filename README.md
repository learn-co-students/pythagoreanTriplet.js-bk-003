# Pythagorean Triplet
## Getting Started

Run `npm install`

## Tests

Run `grunt watch` then edit your files. Grunt will watch for changes. Grunt
will only run tests that start with `it`. When you finish passing a test,
remove the `x` from `xit` to convert it to a runnable test.

## Background

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for which,

a**2 + b**2 = c**2

For example, 3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.
