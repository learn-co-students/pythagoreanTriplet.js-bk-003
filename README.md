# Pythagorean Triplet

## Tests

Review the `triplet.js` file inside the `lib` directory, and then the `triplet.spec.js` file inside the `spec` directory. Review each of the tests, and then start implementing your solutions to make each test pass in `triplet.js`.

## Background

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for which,

a**2 + b**2 = c**2

For example, 3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.
